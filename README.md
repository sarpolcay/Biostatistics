# Biostatistics

This was a university project from the Winter Semester 2021 from the course Biostatistics, where the students had to choose a biostatistical study and present it to the class, explaining the experimental design and the statisical methods used during the study. The final task was to re-demonstrate the statistical methods, and see if we can get the same results.
